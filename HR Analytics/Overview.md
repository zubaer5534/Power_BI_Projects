## Project Overview

We have developed an HR Analytics Intelligence Solution capable of performing real-time data analysis based on your employee data. This solution consolidates & automates all HR reporting and analysis needs in one place, showcasing insights such as **9-box Grid, Employee Turnover/Attrition, Survey & Satisfaction Score, Budget, Increment & Salary Distributions, Resource Utilization, and Leave Management.** Leveraging Statistical Methods, Data Science, Machine Learning & AI, this Solution generates insightful Self-explanatory Analytics which are updated automatically and easy to share with the Stakeholders at different levels with different levels of access.
With this Smart HR Analytics Solution you can make valuable decisions—from tracking employee performance and managing increments to optimizing budgets.

## Data Transformation and Loading
We collected data from a Industry expert and open source. Following dataset were used during this project,

**1. FactPerformanceRating:** Contains information about each employee's job performance ratings across different parameters, along with their manager's ratings of them. <br />
**2. DimEmployee:** Contains employee's personal information, promotion, hiredate, salary and others. <br />
**3. Salary:** Contains employee's salary releted information. <br />
**4. DimEducation:** Contains employee's educational level information upto doctorate degree. <br />
**5. DimSatisfiedLevel:** Contains information about satisfaction levels, rated on a scale from 1 to 5. <br />
**6. DimRatingLevel:** Contains information about rating levels, rated on a scale from 1 to 5. <br />
**7. LeaveRecords:** Contains information about employees' current leave status, including approved and in-process leave requests. <br />
**8. CapexComponents:** Collects information about products purchased by the company for employee use. <br />
**9. DimDate:** Its a calculated table created based on DimEmployee[HireDate].

## DAX Measures
More than 65 DAX were used for this project. Some important DAX are,

<ins>Dynamic Variance %</ins> = 
// MONTH
var latestMonth = CALCULATE(MAX('DimDate'[MonthRelative]), 'DimDate'[Date] = MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate])) <br />
var priorMonthAttr = CALCULATE([% Attrition Rate Date], 'DimDate'[MonthRelative] = latestMonth - 1) <br />
var latestMonthAttr = CALCULATE([% Attrition Rate Date], 'DimDate'[MonthRelative] = latestMonth) <br />
var monthAttrChange = DIVIDE(latestMonthAttr - priorMonthAttr, priorMonthAttr) <br />
var formattedMonthAttr = IF(monthAttrChange < 0, "▼ " & FORMAT(ABS(monthAttrChange), "0.00%"), "▲ " & FORMAT(monthAttrChange, "0.00%")) & " vs previous month" <br />
// QUARTER <br />
var latestQuarter = CALCULATE(MAX('DimDate'[QuarterRelative]), 'DimDate'[Date] = MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate])) <br />
var priorQuarterAttr = CALCULATE([% Attrition Rate Date], 'DimDate'[QuarterRelative] = latestQuarter - 1) <br />

var latestYear = CALCULATE(MAX('DimDate'[YearRelative]), 'DimDate'[Date] = MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate])) <br />
