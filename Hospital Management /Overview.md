## Project Overview
We have developed a Healthcare Analytics Intelligence Solution capable of performing real-time data analysis based on patients and operational dummy data. This solution consolidates & automates all Healthcare reporting and analysis needs in one place, showcasing insights such as **Bed Management, Financial Tracking, Patient flow Management, Discharge & Readmission Rates, Survey & Satisfaction Score, Resource Utilizations, Staff Management.**  Leveraging Statistical Methods, Data Science, Machine Learning & AI, this Solution generates insightful Self-explanatory Analytics which are updated automatically and easy to share with the Stakeholders at different level with different level of access.

_With this Smart Healthcare Analytics Solution, you can make valuable decisions—from tracking patients’ outcomes and managing resource allocations to optimizing budgets and enhancing patient care._

## Data Transformation and Loading
We created these data using Generative AI. Following dataset were used during this project,

**1. C_Doctor:** Contains each doctors information including salary, fees and specialization. <br />
**2. C_TratmentCost:** Contains information about the doctor's fee, test fees, and expenses incurred by the patient. <br />
**3. C_Facility:** Aggregated data categorized by region. <br />
**4. C_Patient Details:** Includes information of each patient, covering both inpatients and outpatients. <br />
**5. C_Nurse:** Contains information of each nurse with department. <br />
**6. C_Supply:** Contains information about every product and its availability. <br />
**7. C_Survey:** Collects information from patients about their hospital experience based on specific parameters. <br />
**8. C_Sat Category:** Collects information from patients about their satisfaction. <br />
**9. C_Survey Qts:** Asks centain questions to every patients. <br />
**10. C_DateTable:** Its a calculated table created by using Visit Date column of C_Patient Details Table.

## DAX Measures
More than 75 DAX were used for this project. Some important DAX are,

<ins>Beds in Use</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Admission Date] <> BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] = BLANK()
)

<ins>Occupancy Rate</ins> = 
DIVIDE([Beds in Use], [Total Beds], 0)

<ins>ICU_BEDS_IN_USE</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Admission Date] <> BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] = BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Bed Type] = "ICU Bed"
)

<ins>Census Patients</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Admission Date] <> BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] = BLANK()
)

<ins>Total Discharge Patients</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    NOT(ISBLANK('C_Patient Details'[Admission Date])),
    NOT(ISBLANK('C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date]))
)

<ins>Total Inpatients</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Visit Date] <> BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Admission Date] <> BLANK()
)

<ins>Total Long Stay Patients</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    DATEDIFF('C_Patient Details'[Admission Date], 'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date], DAY) > 10
)

<ins>Total Outpatients</ins> = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Visit Date] <> BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Admission Date] = BLANK(),
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] = BLANK()
)

<ins>Unique Patients Discharged in Last 7 Days from Max Date</ins> = 
VAR MaxDischargeDate = MAX('C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('C_Patient Details'[Patient ID]),
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] >= MaxDischargeDate - 6 && 
    'C_Patient Details'[Discharge Date] <= MaxDischargeDate
)

<ins>Satisfaction Rate</ins> = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('C_Survey'), 
        'C_Survey'[Score] IN {4, 5}),
    COUNTROWS('C_Survey')
)
